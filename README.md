# Cards Against Pandemic

An online / web version of [Cards Against Humanity](https://cardsagainsthumanity.com/), built in desperate times.

This was built to play Cards Against while on video call with friends during the COVID-19 lockdown, mainly because the other versions available felt a bit hard to use and I thought I'd have a go myself.

I got this into a _just about_ playable state, had a bunch of games, then haven't worked on it since. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
If you do come across this and want to raise issues or even better a PR, please do!
