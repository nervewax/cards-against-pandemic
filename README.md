# cards-against-pandemic

An online / web version of [Cards Against Humanity](https://cardsagainsthumanity.com/), built in desperate times.

This was built to play Cards Against while on video call with friends during the COVID pandemic, as the other versions available felt a bit hard to use. I got this into a _just about_ playable state, had a bunch of games, then haven't worked on it since. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

💾 - Built using [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [socket.io](https://socket.io/).
🃏 - Cards json sourced from [JSON Against Humanity](https://crhallberg.com/cah/)
